    "Course **lectures** will consist of complete notebooks that we step through together as a class to understand how different inputs produce different outputs. Course **exercises** will consist of incomplete notebooks that you will complete on your own (you may ask others / myself for hints if you get stumped). \n",

    "The part of each exercise that needs to be completed will be marked with a `TODO` comment. If there is no `TODO`, then you should be able to run the cell without making any changes. For example, in the first code cell below, you will see that the csv library has already been imported for you; there is no `TODO` above the `import` line. However, the `TODO` two lines below specifies that you will need to complete the code to import each collision table using the [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) library."

Following the instructions from the \"Software Installation\" and from the package's GitHub install page, go ahead and install the package. \n",

You can confirm the installation is successful by running the cells below to import the package. _A note about importing packages: You only need to import the python package once each time during each Python session. Once you close the notebook (and therefore shut down the python kernel), you will need to import the packages again the next time you start the notebook._\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 3: Read Documentation for Specific Functions to download data\n",
    "Once you've imported the package, check the package-specific documentation for how to download data.
