## Pre-Course Instructions
Welcome! So that we can spend most of our limited time working through core concepts, we ask that you complete the following before the start of the course.
1. Complete Python Prerequisites
    - Coursera Courses [Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python) and [Python Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data/home) or
    - Read the book and complete the exercises in [Python for Everyone](https://www.py4e.com/)
2. Complete the [Software Setup](https://github.com/black-tea/ucla-its-data-camp-2019/blob/master/Pre-Course/Software-Setup.md) and read both the [Programming Landscape](https://github.com/black-tea/ucla-its-data-camp-2019/blob/master/Pre-Course/Programming-Landscape.md) and [Considerations for Data Projects](https://github.com/black-tea/ucla-its-data-camp-2019/blob/master/Pre-Course/Considerations-for-Data-Projects.md). 
3. Download/Fork Geoff Boeing's [Urban Data Science Course repository](https://github.com/gboeing/urban-data-science). The lessons in this camp will mirror much of the work in that course, and we will be stepping through his notebooks to demonstrate core concepts.
4. Complete the Pre-Course Activity (Pre-Course-Activity.ipynb)
