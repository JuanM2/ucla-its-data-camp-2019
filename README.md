    - The landscape of tools & resources
    - Intro to Notebooks (we will be using Jupyter notebooks), Code Commenting, Markdown 
    - Organizing Projects, Presenting Findings, Reproducibility  
- Getting & Wrangling Data (50%)

    - Getting Data: From reading flat files such as CSVs, from the web using an API
    - Reshaping Data (Pandas)
    - Writing helper functions 
    - Writing Output
- Analytical Tasks (30%)  
    - Summarizing data to produce findings
    - Leveraging libraries to produce graphs & charts
    - End course with brief intro into types of models, Sci-Kit learn, etc.

### Prerequisites
- Knowledge:  Students should have some basic working programming knowledge already and should be able to write small functions, install & import relevant packages, and be able to perform some basic data manipulation.  Students who complete the Coursera course [Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python) will be prepared.  
- Software: Anaconda w/ Jupyter Notebook setup & installed. Tim will be available to help with any install issues before the class starts.

### Course Format
Morning: Work through notebook examples from Geoff Boeing's [Urban Data Science course](https://github.com/gboeing/urban-data-science) & any other lecture material  
Late Morning / Afternoon: Students complete exercises (unfinished notebooks) prepared by Tim  
Afternoon: Students work on individual projects, with Tim/Juan available to help and answer any questions
